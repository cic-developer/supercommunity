The nature of blockchain 
</li>
    <li><p>
Blockchain is an important future technology industry, and over time more people and capitals are gathering. 
In the new technology fields, the public or even the workers often find it difficult to define and classify blockchain. 
Blockchain is a new invention for data transmission, and tokens or coins derived from the blockchain are fundamentally a tool for exchanging values between people. 
Coins and tokens work as promised by people on the framework of the blockchain in terms of their value exchange method. 
As a result of the promise, coins or tokens i.e. digital assets, can be stocks of the company, a point that users can use directly on the business platform, or they can be both at the same time. 
Of course, it can become one of the new ways of storing value such as Bitcoin. 
The important thing is that the complexity of accumulating the concept of a blockchain comes from the rules that people set in order for its operation.
The essence of the blockchain is the exchange of values. </p></li>

<li class="sub_title">
Blockchain and Business 
</li>

<li><p>
Bitcoin and several stablecoins are bringing great innovation to the existing financial industry.
Platform coins such as Ethereum are coins for coins that are expanding into the technology research of the blockchain so that the blockchain technology can be applied to businesses in various fields of society. 
Most of the other coins supported by these technology platforms, are utilized coins that are derived from the operating system and are being introduced to the business. These are precisely called tokens, not coins. 
That is, most of the tokens currently available are introducing the points in each company&#39;s business model to the blockchain instead of the existing centralized data system. 
A new business model may be born from this, but they will most likely recognize the transparency and decentralization of the blockchain as an advantage to have a competitive edge in business. Our SUPER COMMUNITY and PER tokens are such business models. 
However, the purpose of adopting blockchain for most businesses is to preoccupy new opportunities in the industrial structure that changes due to blockchain in the future. 
We are expecting more innovative and efficient changes in the online community market and advertising market with the use of blockchain, and we will develop our business to be at the center of it.

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Blockchain technology enables the exchange of values among users through distributed ledger without central administrator intervention, which means that data records cannot be falsified/modified and their contents are transparent. 
        It&#39;s possible because of the trust you get. Blockchain technology will be applied to various industries in the future, which will have a huge impact on society. 
        Today, many coins, including Ethereum, EOS, and Cardano, do not reach the level of scalability that allows various applications/interfaces of the block chain across multiple businesses. 
        Faced with these technical challenges, block chain technology is now a major focus on finance. This is the most basic exchange of values. 
        An attempt is being made to utilize the functionality. But what we&#39;re paying attention to is that the current use of block chain technology is not limited to institutional friction. 
        It is the use of a rewinding platform where platform activities and rewards are given rather than in the severe financial sector. Simple exchange of values is the core function of the current block chain.

        Application of Blockchain and<br> Digital Assets to Business Models 
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        We must keep in mind that it takes a lot more time to accept and use it socially and institutionally than the pace of technology&#39;s development. 
        In the future, only platforms where digital assets are used and operated will survive, with minimal impact on the level of block chain technology and regulations. 
        You need to know. Many digital asset projects have overlooked this point, and they just think of ICO as an easy way to raise money, and digital assets fit together. 
        They tried to force the use of digital assets on a non-business model, and most of the projects are disappearing quickly.
        Digital assets cannot exist without block chain technology, but block chain technology can be used without digital assets.

    <li class="sub_title">
        Autonomous Advertising Compensation Platform 
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Our project maximizes viral marketing effects by attracting marketing from various participants through intuitive rewards. 
        Ultimately, we want to create an "autonomous ecosystem" in which not only influencer but also individuals become members of marketing. 
        Over time, SUPER COMMUNITY&#39;s involvement will be minimized and participants will receive a meaningful "reasonable reward." 
        In the future, instead of acting as an administrator in the ecosystem cycle, the company will switch to a role as a facilitator in securing online and offline use of tokens. 
        This is an intuitive and realistic project that can produce viral marketing effects in its own promotional media and in all individuals&#39; media. 
        As the number of platform/community members increases, demand for advertising and use of coins increases, token prices will rise, and due to the virtuous cycle of the ecosystem, 
        In addition to expectations of a rise in value, the company actively responded to the current realistic situation of the coin market, resulting in a substantial rise in value, such as listing on the exchange and controlling distribution volume. 
        I will try to do it.

        The platform&#39;s promotional effect is to focus on raising value by informing you of this token as your first marketing goal. 
        The focus will be on proving that it is valid. In the current coin market, business progress and token value are simultaneously maintained. 
        Consider it before you succeed. Because the increase in the value of coins is the best way to promote them. In the beginning, as a token/ coin promotion platform, we&#39;re going to be 
        It will become a very effective means of public relations. It will eventually expand into viral marketing projects on a wide range of topics.

        The goal is to ensure that the system is in a voluntary virtuous cycle because the operating principle prevents SUPER COMMUNITY from being involved.<br><br>
        In this structure, the toad is essential to the operation of the platform. The transactions documented in the block chain are paid by advertisers, ensuring reliability of the platform. 
        SUPER COMMUNITY loses control of the token distributed to the user, making the points attributed to the user better asset value. That&#39;s a lot more participants. 
        I can make it. As the ecosystem expands, the value of PER tokens increases due to the principle of supply and demand. In the long run, tokens have a certain level of value and are actively used. 
        Rewards for advertising activities can be easily obtained oldspan class="p_bold">"누"누/span>, and this token is immediately cashed in or as a good participation reward with many direct uses. 
        The goal is to become a viral marketing company that makes every individual a marketer and the subject of advertising.<br><br>
        We are not competing with existing platform companies such as Facebook and YouTube, but rather, our ecosystem participants use existing platforms as tools to help expand our ecosystem.

$lang[12] =' (https://docs.klaytn.com/api/platform). This transaction is sent to the Consensus Node (CN) and stored in a block.             
    The CN checks the validity of the received transactions. Valid transactions are stored or discarded in the transaction pool. The CN selects a viable transaction within the current block in the transaction pool and executes one each. To execute a transaction, the sender must pay a partial KLAY fee for the transaction. 
    The transaction costs paid in clay (KLAY) are calculated based on multiplier effects such as gas and gas costs. Gas is the basic unit of calculation. All activities running on the Claytn node consume a predefined amount of gas. The exact amount of clay (KLAY) required for a transaction is calculated by the formula specified in the transaction cost. (https://docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/computation/exec_model). If the sender submits a transaction when there is insufficient gas, the 22 transactions may fail, and even if the sender&#39;s account balance is insufficient, the transaction may fail.             
    If the transaction runs successfully, it will be included in the current block. The CN collects transactions until the block gas limit or block time limit is reached, and the CN creates blocks from the transaction. At this stage, you must populate several fields in the block. For example, you need to calculate the hash value, amount received, and status of the transaction. After completing all required fields, the CN generates a block hash.             
    After completing block creation, the block is propagated to all other CNs. The other CN checks the transmitted blocks and uses the BFT consensus algorithm to reach an agreement on the verification results. Once the verification process has been successfully completed by most CNs, the blocks are stored within the block chain.             
    Because the BFT consensus algorithm satisfies the direct certainty property, the block is final and will never be removed. Once the block is finalized, the execution of all transactions in the block is irreversible and the execution results can be recovered if requested by the sender.             
    Create Smart Contracts - In Clayton (Klaytn) Blockchain, smart contracts can be created by sending transactions to empty addresses and using binaries as data. Although binaries can be in many formats, Clayton (Klaytn) currently only supports EVN byte code.             
    The important thing is that these transactions require payment for execution. The sender&#39;s account balance decreases depending on the transaction cost model after the transaction is stored in the block. After a certain period of time, the transaction appears in the block and confirms that the accompanying status has been agreed. At this point, smart contracts exist in Clayton Blockchain. 
    <br><br>';//
$lang[13] ='';//내용 감추기
$lang[14] =' Smart Contract Execution - The functions of a smart contract can be invoked and executed by sending transactions to a smart contract or by invoking functions to a node. 
If you send a transaction to invoke a function, the function is executed by processing the transaction. 
This includes the cost of sending transactions within the clay (KLAY), and calls are recorded in the block chain forever. 
The return value of this generated call is the hash of the transaction.
When the feature is applied, it runs internally in the Clayton (Klaytn) virtual machine (KLVM), and the call returns the function&#39;s return value. The internal status of the contract cannot be modified because these generated calls are not recorded in the block chain.             
This type of call is called a constant function call. This generated call does not require a clay (KLAY). 
Constant function calls should be used when return values are applicable, and transactions should be used when side effects of contract status are applicable.             
Clayton (Klaytn) Token and Transaction Costs - Clay (KLAY) is a major internal transactionable crypto of Clayton (KLAY) and is used to create or execute smart contracts or pay transaction costs for Clay (KLAY) remittances. 
Clay (KLAY) is primarily a fuel requirement for Clayton (Klaytn) network operations. 
This is a consensual node (CN) for executing the requested activity in the form of payment made by platform users.
 In other words, clay (KLAY) is an incentive and ensures developers use high-quality applications and maintain the network&#39;s health line (which requires higher fees for wasteful code). 
 (The Clayton (Klaytn) node is compensated for the resources it contributes.) 
 Transaction costs within Clayton (Klaytn) can be calculated in a variety of ways, depending on the execution environment in which the transaction runs.             
 For example, the current transaction cost for Clayton (Klaytn) virtual machines (KLVMs) can be calculated as follows:             : Transaction cost : = F (total gas used) x (unit price) ● F() can be a step-by-step pricing function. 
 This feature is not yet confirmed and may change with further development of Clayton (Klaytn). Clayton (Klaytn) For a testnet, F() is an anisotropic function, and transaction costs can be simply calculated as (total gas) X (unit price). ● Total gas used can be calculated by KLVM according to the gas cost and the unique gas cost of the OP Code. 
 These calculated transaction costs are deducted from the balance of the sender&#39;s or corporate account according to the transaction. For more information on KLAY tokens and transaction costs, please check out the Claytn documentation on the website.             
 (https://docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/computation/exec_model). <br><br> 
 service chain - The service chain in Clayton (Klaytn) is an independent secondary block chain that is tailored to individual Bapps that require special node configurations, 
 custom security ratings, or unusually high throughput that make the deployment of the Bapp in the Claytn main chain inconvenient or uneconomical.
